## Installation

**Jekyll Sass Converter requires Jekyll 2.0.0 or greater and is bundled
with Jekyll so you don't need to install it if you're already using Jekyll.**

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'jekyll-sass-converter'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-sass-converter

## Usage

Jekyll Sass Converter comes bundled with Jekyll 2.0.0 and greater. For more
information about usage, visit the [Jekyll Assets Documentation
page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/).

### Source Maps

Starting with `v2.0`, the Converter will by default generate a _source map_ file along with
the `.css` output file. The _source map_ is useful when we use the web developers tools of
[Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) or
[Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools) to debug our `.sass` or `.scss`
stylesheets.

The _source map_ is a file that maps from the output `.css` file to the original source
`.sass` or `.scss` style sheets. Thus enabling the browser to reconstruct the original source
and present the reconstructed original in the debugger.

### Configuration Options

Configuration options are specified in the `_config.yml` file in the following way:

  ```yml
  sass:
    <option_name1>: <option_value1>
    <option_name2>: <option_value2>
  ```

Available options are:

  * **`style`**

    Sets the style of the CSS-output.
    Can be `nested`, `compact`, `compressed`, or `expanded`.
    See the [SASS_REFERENCE](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass#style)
    for details.

    Defaults to `compact`.

  * **`sass_dir`**

    A filesystem-path which should be searched for Sass partials.

    Defaults to `_sass`

  * **`load_paths`**

    An array of additional filesystem-paths which should be searched for Sass partials.

    Defaults to `[]`

  * **`line_comments`**

    When set to _true_, the line number and filename of the source is included in the compiled
    CSS-file. Useful for debugging when the _source map_ is not available, but might
    considerably increase the size of the generated CSS files.

    Defaults to `false`.

  * **`sourcemap`**

    Controls when source maps shall be generated.

    - `never` &mdash; causes no source maps to be generated at all.
    - `always` &mdash; source maps will always be generated.
    - `development` &mdash; source maps will only be generated if the site is in development
      [environment](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/environments/).
      That is, when the environment variable `JEKYLL_ENV` is set to `development`.

    Defaults to `always`.
